# AUE-AutonomousDriving
This repository includes the term project for autonomous driving class.

The project is divided into two parts. For project 1, one needs to complete following tasks:
1. Lane recognition: Recognize lane markers using a camera and filter noises.
2. Camera calibration: Find out the camera parameters from data.
3. Lane tracking control: Design and implement a vehicle controller to make the vehicle track the lane.

For project 2, one needs to complete following tasks using another camera:
1. Train sign detectors. Run detectors and classify signs. 
2. Communication between MATLAB sessions through UDP. 
3. The vehicle should respond to signs properly.

Hardware and software requirments:
1. Traxxs radio control truck.
2. Arduino board.
3. PC with MATLAB.
